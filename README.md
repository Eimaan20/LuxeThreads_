# LuxeThreads_ Frontend Internship Project
It is a beautifully crafted 'Desi' brand website built to reflect a soft theme, smooth interactions, and a premium clothing identity. The project originated as the vision of a creative, talented woman working from home, who transformed a simple idea into a graceful, home-grown fashion label—celebrated for elegance, craftsmanship, and modern design.

## Overview
A 4-page responsive  'Desi' clothing brand website built with Bootstrap 5, AOS animations, and a soft theme.

## Pages
- `index.html` — Home (hero, featured collection, testimonials)
- `about.html` — Brand story & mission
- `gallery.html` — Lookbook (6 images with hover effects)
- `contact.html` — Contact form (front-end only)

## Tech
- HTML5, CSS3, JS
- Bootstrap 5 (CDN)
- AOS.js (CDN)

## How to run
1. Clone or download the project folder.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser or use VS Code Live Server for hot reload.
3. Replace images in `assets/images/` with real product photos.

## Notes
- Contact form is front-end only. If backend is required later, we can add Node.js/Flask endpoint to store submissions.
